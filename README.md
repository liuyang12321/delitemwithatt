# 插件用途

删除条目或分类的同时将附件也一块删除。


从[https://github.com/redleafnew/delitemwithatt/releases](https://github.com/redleafnew/delitemwithatt/releases)下载xpi，然后在Zotero或JurisM中通过Tools-Addons-Install Add-on From File安装。安装完成后在条目上右击会出现：`删除附件`，如果条目有附件，会出现三个子菜单，`删除附件和条目`，`仅删除所有附件`，`仅删除快照`，点击后条目包括附件、附件或快照会被删除（包括文件）。在分类上右击时会出现：`删除分类条目包括附件`，确认后会在删除分类的同时将分类中的条目包含附件删除，快照也认为是附件。**注意：删除时链接文件不进回收站，直接删除，请删除前备份**。
